`LeapLedger` is a free and open-source accounting software with a decoupled front-end and back-end. Powered by `Flutter`, it provides a smooth and seamless user experience, easily extending to iOS, Mac, and Windows in the future. The server is built using the `Gin` framework, implemented with `NATS`, `MySQL`, and `Redis`, offering fast responses and stable services. Deployment and building of client installation packages can be quickly achieved using `Docker`.

## What We Have
* :iphone: A powerful architecture based on Flutter, providing a smooth user experience, easily extendable to iOS, Mac, and Windows in the future.

* :whale: Whether it's server deployment or client packaging, everything is handled through Docker. :parasol_on_ground:

### Features
* :family_man_woman_girl_boy: Shared ledgers that sync records with your partner and family while maintaining independent bookkeeping.

* :timer_clock: Scheduled bookkeeping for fixed monthly expenses like rent and communication fees—no more manual entry hassle!

* :credit_card: Only want to handle the accounts once a month? No problem, we can import bills from Alipay and WeChat.

In addition to these, we also have:
* :books: Multi-ledger management and :earth_africa: timezone-ledgers.
* Clear views to understand recent situations.
* Easily browse records and charts. :bar_chart:

### API Services
We have a fast, responsive, and stable API service.

* :shield: Ledger authentication based on the Gin middleware and JWT identity verification ensures security.

* :zap: Asynchronous and event-driven architecture based on NATS provides faster responses.

* :mailbox: The Outbox pattern ensures data consistency while operating asynchronously. :dart:

* :floppy_disk: Dead-letter queues guarantee message retention, enhancing system stability.

* :arrows_counterclockwise: Database updates and initialization based on `Gorm` ensure seamless API service upgrades.

## Running/Deployment
Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZiRunHua/LeapLedger.git
```
First, start MySQL:
```bash
docker-compose up -d leap-ledger-mysql
```
Check the MySQL logs and wait for ready for connections before executing `docker-compose up -d`:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f leap-ledger-mysql
```
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Access http://localhost:8080/public/health to verify the service.

For custom configurations, refer to: [./config.yaml](./config.yaml)

For client packaging details, visit: https://github.com/ZiRunHua/LeapLedger-App

### Build Image

The `docker/Dockerfile` can build an image with a Go compilation environment. However, since Go only needs the binary files to run, you can build a minimal image.

Minimal image:
```bash
docker build -t xiaozirun/leap-ledger:build -f docker/Dockerfile.build .
```
Remote debugging image on port 2345:
```bash
docker build -t xiaozirun/leap-ledger:debug -f docker/Dockerfile.debug .
```
Testing image:
```bash
docker build -t xiaozirun/leap-ledger:test -f docker/Dockerfile.test .
```
Please note the differences in image tags.
